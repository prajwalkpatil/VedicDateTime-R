# Background
I am a Sophomore pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at KLE Technological University, Hubballi, Karnataka, India. I started my Computer science journey from web development in 8th Grade of my school. I learnt Front-end development and Javascript completing Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Then, I participated in Google Code-In 2016, 2017 where I was introduced to the world of open source - GitHub and Git. Since then, I have hardly faced any problems with Git and Github. I got great experience collaborating with mentors and organizations. When I joined my college I learnt C and C++ and thus I formally got into programming. I completed a Data structures, Algorithms and a DBMS course in my college. I am learning Object Oriented Programming in C++, Data Analysis in Python and Applied Statistics in R. 

I can develop advanced applications built using C and C++ with extensive use of Data structures and Algorithms. I can create websites from scratch or by using libraries, frameworks.

I built a reddit clone(terminal based) purely using C, where I created a special data structure on my own for retrieval and storing of data. I devised a method of storing nested data in secondary storage without using any kind of database management softwares.

I have worked on projects that relied on memory management in C and projects that required a great deal of knowledge of data structures. I am currently working on my personal website.

# Why did I choose this project?
The R project organization matched my tech stack so I went ahead to explore the projects. Then I came across VedicDateTime. This project got stuck in my head since then. 

I was born on Ugadi(Gudi Padwa) which is the new year of Hindu calendar. Since my childhood my family has been celebrating my birthday based on the tithi of Hindu calendar. My birthday doesn’t lie on the same date every year. When I was a child, I used to ask my mother why is it like that? Then she explained to me that my birthday every year is based on the astronomical positions. All of that didn’t make much sense then but now It certainly makes a lot of sense.

This project revived my curiosity regarding this topic and thus I set my voyage in the search of knowing more things about the Hindu calendar/ Hindu Panchang. 

Hindu Vedic calendar is based on the Panchang(a booklet with astronomical calculations) . I started understanding that. I had a Panchang in my home and the elders of my home are well versed in interpreting the Panchang so I took their help.I understood it and now I am pretty much clear with what should be done in this project.

# Summary
`	`Moon phases greatly influence the weather conditions on the earth - Durations of ocean tides, chances of rainfall etc. The Sun's influence on earth is well known - seasons, temperature, agricultural growth and many other things. By only using the solar or lunar calendar, we are missing out on some or the other things. Why not have the best of both worlds? That's why there is a huge possibility that the world might turn towards a lunisolar vedic hindu calendar in near future.

Hindu Vedic Calendar considers both solar and lunar activities; this is particularly useful because the Gregorian calendar just considers the Earth’s revolution around the sun. Each month of the Gregorian calendar has 30 or 31 days. Number of days in February also depends on the leap year but, in the case of the Vedic Calendar system, each maasa(month) always consists of 2 pakshas that is 30 days. To adjust the gap additional days are added by an adhika maasa which comes after every 32.5 months. The main feature of Vedic Calendar would be the consideration of Lunar activities - waxing and waning of the moon. Two pakshas of a maasa – Shukla paksha and Krishna paksha. Each paksha has 15 tithis, Shukla paksha ending with a Purnima (full moon) and Krishna paksha with an Amavasya (new moon).

`	`As per the Vedas and Vedic Calendar, time is cyclic which is called as Kala Chakra other Calendars consider time as something which is linear. Each Samvatsara has 360 days and there are 60 samvatsaras which repeat every 60 years. Vedic calendar is nothing but a part of Panchangs which consists of Sunrise and Sunset times, Rahu Kala etc. Each period has its own scientific importance, like accurately predicting the solar and lunar eclipses.
